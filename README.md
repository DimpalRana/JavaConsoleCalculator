# Task 1: Java Console Calculator

## Description
This Java program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a console interface.  
It demonstrates how methods and loops can be used to perform repetitive tasks like multiple calculations.

## How It Works
- The program takes two numbers as input from the user.
- It asks the user to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
- Methods are used to perform each operation.
- A loop allows the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.
- Division by zero is handled safely.

## Example
Choose operation: 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0

## How to Run
1. Copy the Java code from `Calculator.java`.
2. Compile: `javac Calculator.java`
3. Run: `java Calculator`
4. Follow the console prompts to perform calculations.
